## What does Friday do?

### Assign issue to Univer members

When an issue is created, Friday will assign it to a Univer member according to the `scope:x` tag. For example, if an issue has a `scope:core` tag, Friday will assign it to a Univer member who is responsible for `packages/core`.

Tags and their corresponding owners should be listed in each repository's config file.

### Arrange quality assurance tasks for pull requests

When a pull request is created, Friday will check if its title begins with `fix` or `feat`. It so, it will add a `pr:bugfix` or `pr:feature`, and a `qa:untested` label and assign it to QA team members. Friday will forbid a PR to being merged before the `qa:untested` label is removed and a `qa:verified` label is added.
